<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p>The mutiny of the German sailors at Kiel is now explained. They
preferred death to another speech from the KAISER.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Constantinople poet has translated the plays of SHAKSPEARE
into Turkish. The rendering is said to be faithful to the text, and
it is assumed that a keen appreciation of Turkey's military
necessities alone accounts for his reference to the "Swan of Avon"
as the "Bulbul of Potsdam."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The use of flour as an ingredient of sausages is now forbidden.
Young sausages which have hitherto been fed on bread and milk must
either be broken to bones or killed for the table.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An optimist writes to express the hope that by this elimination
of flour the dreadful secret of the sausage may be at last
revealed.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The German Government has created a Pulp Commission. We have
always said they would be reduced to it in time.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The King of SIAM'S royal yacht has been turned into a cargo
boat. Reports that the Sacred White Elephant has been commandeered
for use as a floating dock are still unconfirmed.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>For giving corn to pheasants a fine of ten pounds has been
inflicted on a merchant of New York (Lincs.) The removal <i>en
bloc</i> of this village from the mouth of the Hudson river to its
present site should finally convince the sceptics of the magnitude
of America's war effort.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The Vacant Land Cultivation Society offers a prize of ten
shillings for the heaviest potato. Some of our most notorious
potato-tellers are expected to compete.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The provision of steel helmets for the Metropolitan Police is
all right so far as it goes, but the Force is still asking why it
cannot be furnished with some protection for its other
extremities.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>From China it is reported that an aboriginal priest now claiming
the Throne has been accustomed to eat the flesh of tigers, wolves,
leopards, &amp;c., also the human heart. It is, however, only fair
to our own restaurateurs to state that, though China is alleged to
be on the eve of war, there is as yet no food-control in that
country.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An unusual scarcity of wasps is reported from various parts of
the country. Nothing is being done about it.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A calf has been sold for two thousand seven hundred guineas in
Aberdeenshire. The plucky purchaser is understood to have had for
some time past a craving for a veal cutlet.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A new form of frightfulness is evidently being practised upon
their guards by our interned Huns. "Some of them," says a
contemporary, "purchase a hundred cigars with a portion of the one
pound a day which is the miserable maximum they may spend on
luxuries."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"People who speak of suicide seldom do anything desperate," says
a well-known mental expert. So that the KAISER'S threat to fight
England to the death may be taken for what it is worth.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An extraordinary meeting of German Reichstag Members has arrived
at the decision that the Germans cannot hope for victory in the
field. We see nothing extraordinary in this.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Professor BERGEN was once described as "the well-known inventor
and philanthropist." He still invents (his latest is a gas-thrower,
reported by the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> to be "a veritable
monster of destruction"), but has dropped the other job.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A swallow-tail butterfly which escaped from the Zoo has been
re-captured at Eastbourne. When caught it gave the policeman to
understand that it would go quietly.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Two men, we read, took twenty-two hours to chisel a hole through
the three-foot flint concrete roof of the London Opera House. The
report that they did this to avoid the Entertainment Tax has now
been contradicted.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"The American Winston Churchill," says <i>The Daily Express</i>,
"has to plod through life without a middle name." We all have our
little cross to bear. Even the MINISTER OF MUNITIONS has to plod
through life with the knowledge that there is another Winston
Churchill loose about the world.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is proposed that Parliament shall sit from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.,
instead of from 3 to 11 P.M. We do not care for this crude attempt
to mix business with politics.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The Boundary Commission Report advocates the creation of
thirty-one new M.P.'s. It will be a bitter disappointment for those
who were sanguine enough to hope that Redistribution would spell
Reform.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The Government has commandeered all stocks of rum. The rigours
of war, it seems, must be suffered even by our little tots.</p>

<h2>THE INNOCENTS ABROAD.</h2>
<blockquote class="note">
<p>["Stedfastness and righteousness are the qualities which the
German people value in the highest degree, and which have brought
it a good and honourable reputation in the whole world. When we
make experiments in lies and deception, intrigue and low cunning,
we suffer hopeless and brutal failure. Our lies are coarse and
improbable, our ambiguity is pitiful simplicity. The history of the
War proves this by a hundred examples. When our enemies poured all
these things upon us like a hailstorm, and we convinced ourselves
of the effectiveness of such tactics, we tried to imitate them. But
these tactics will not fit the German. We are rough but moral, we
are credulous but honest."&mdash;<i>Herr DERNBURG, in "Deutsche

<h2>THE CARP AT MIRAMEL.</h2>
<blockquote class="note">
<p>[In the following article all actual names, personal,
geographical and regimental, have been duly camouflaged.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The carp that live in the moat of the Ch&acirc;teau de Miramel
(in the zone of the armies in France) are of an age and ugliness
incredible and of a superlative cynicism. One of them&mdash;local
tradition pointed to a one-eyed old reprobate with a yellow
face&mdash;is the richer these hundred years past by an English
peeress's diamond ring.</p>
<p>From the bottom of the moat one world-war is like another, and
none of them very different from peace. It is but a row of grinning
red healthy faces over the coping and a shower of bread and
biscuit.</p>
<p>When the nightmare of BONAPARTE was ended in the Autumn of 1815,
the 22nd K.R. Lancers, commanded by an English peer, billeted
themselves in and around the Ch&acirc;teau de Miramel. The English
peer, finding time hang heavy on his hands, or my lady's letters
proving insistent, sent for her to come out to him at Miramel. You
could do that sort of homely thing in 1815.</p>
<p>So my lady comes to Miramel, and the very first day, as she
leans out of window in the round tower, mishandles her diamond ring
(gift of my lord) and drops it into the moat. Her host, the good
Comte de Miramel, dredged and drained, but no trace of the diamond
ring was ever found. But old Cyclops, the carp, grinned
horribly.</p>
<p>In due course my lord and lady went home to the Isle of Fogs,
and thence they sent their portraits to their host as a souvenir of
their stay. Here indeed the portraits still hang, very graceful in
the style of the period. And to the appreciative visitor Madame de
Miramel (of to-day) shows a missive of thanks, written in
indifferent bad French, in which my lady refers sorrowfully to
"<i>ma bague diamant&eacute;e</i>."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Once again the 22nd K.R. Lancers are billeted in Miramel. The
other day I noticed on a worn stone pillar at the great door the
following half-obliterated words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ED. WYNN, pikeman of the dashing 22nd King's Ryol ridgemet of
lanciers. Sept. 1815";</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and freshly scratched above the inscription:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Better at piking than at speling.</p>
<p class="i4">22nd K.R. Lancers. JAS. BARNET. Sept. 1917."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The old carp seems to be right, and one war is very like
another. There is no radical change in the orthography of the 22nd
King's Royal Lancers, and some-one else's wall is still the medium
for self-expression.</p>
<p>Old Cyclops must be throwing his mind back a hundred years or
so. There is a rain of bread and biscuits into the moat and a ring
of red grinning faces above the coping. Yesterday I threw a disused
safety-razor blade over the old scoundrel's nose. And "Bless my
soul!" he said, as he lazily bolted it, "there hasn't been such a
year for minnows since 1815."</p>
<p>But Armageddon 1917 holds surprises even for those who live at
the bottom of a moat. For very early this morning a bauble fell
into the moat that Cyclops himself couldn't digest. The old cynic
was found floating, scarred belly upwards, on the surface of the
water.</p>
<p>The mess-waiter took charge of the <i>post-mortem</i>. Like the
<i>Duke of Plaza Toro</i>, he "likes an interment" and rarely
misses a last rite. A keen fisherman, he had little difficulty in
extracting an exhibit for the Court's inspection, which he
unhesitatingly pronounced to be a diamond ring in an advanced state
of decomposition.</p>
<p>The mess-cook, on the other hand, identified the relic as the
stopping, recently mislaid, from one of his back teeth.</p>
<p>In any case there seems little room for doubt that a Hun airman
has avenged the long-dead lady.</p>

<h2>THE MUD LARKS.</h2>
<p>All the world has marvelled at "the irrepressible good humour"
of old Atkins. Every distinguished tripper who comes Cook's-touring
to the Front for a couple of days devotes at least a chapter of his
resultant book to it. "How in thunder does Thomas do it?" they ask.
"What the mischief does he find to laugh at?" Listen.</p>
<p>Years ago, when the well-known War was young, a great man sat in
his sanctum exercising his grey matter. Ho said to himself, "There
is a War on. Men, amounting to several, will be prised loose from
comfortable surroundings and condemned to get on with it for the
term of their unnatural lives. They will be shelled, gassed, mined
and bombed, smothered in mud, worked to the bone, bored stiff and
scared silly. Fatigues will be unending, rations short, rum
diluted, reliefs late and leave nil. Their girls will forsake them
for diamond-studded munitioneers. Their wives will write saying,
'Little Jimmie has the mumps; and what about the rent? You aren't
spending all of five bob a week on yourself, are you?' This is but
a tithe (or else a tittle) of the things that will occur to them,
and their sunny natures will sour and sicken if something isn't
done about it."</p>
<p>The great man sat up all night chewing penholders and pondering
on the problem. The BIG IDEA came with the end of the eighth
penholder.</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet, fires of inspiration flashing from his
eyes, and boomed, "Let there be <i>Funny Cuts</i>!"&mdash;then went
to bed. Next morning he created "I." (which stands for
Intelligence), carefully selected his Staff, arrayed them in tabs
of appropriate hue, and told them to go the limit. And they have
been going it faithfully ever since. What the Marines are to the
Senior Service, "I." is to us. Should a Subaltern come in with the
yarn that the spook of HINDENBURG accosted him at Bloody Corner and
offered him a cigar, or a balloon cherub buttonhole you with the
story of a Bosch tank fitted with rubber tyres, C-springs and hot
and cold water, that he has seen climbing trees behind St. Quentin,
we retort, "Oh, go and tell it to 'I.'" and then sit back and see
what the inspired official organ of the green tabs will make of it.
A hint is as good as a wink to them, a nudge ample. Under the
genius of these imaginative artists the most trivial incident
burgeons forth into a LE QUEUX spell-binder, and the whole British
Army, mustering about its Sergeant-Majors, gets selected cameos
read to it every morning at roll-call, laughs brokenly into the
jaws of dawn and continues chuckling to itself all day. Now you
know.</p>
<p>Our Adjutant had a telephone call not long ago. "Army speaking,"
said a voice. "Will you send somebody over to Rataplan and see if
there is a Town Major there?"</p>
<p>The Adjutant said he would, and a N.C.O. was despatched
forthwith. He returned later, reporting no symptoms of one, so the
Adjutant rang up Exchange and asked to be hooked on to Army
Headquarters. "Which branch?" Exchange inquired. "Why, really I
don't know&mdash;forgot to ask," the Adjutant confessed. "I'll have
a try at 'A.'"</p>
<p>"Hello," said "A." "There is no Town Major at Rataplan," said
the Adjutant. "You astound me, Fair Unknown," said "A."; "but what
about it, anyway?" The Adjutant apologised and asked Exchange for
"Q." department. "Hello," said "Q." "There is no Town Major at
Rataplan," said the Adjutant. "Sorry, old thing, whoever you are,"
said "Q.," "but we don't stock 'em. Rations, iron; perspirators,
box; oil, whale, delivered with promptitude and civility, but NOT
Town Majors&mdash;sorry." The Adjutant sighed and consulted with
Exchange as to who possibly could have rung him up.</p>
<p>Exchange couldn't guess unless it was "I."&mdash;no harm in
trying, anyhow.</p>
<p>"Hello!" said "I." "There is no Town Major at Rataplan," the
Adjutant, droned somewhat wearily. "Wha-t!" "I." exclaimed,
suddenly interested. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id=
"page267"></a>[pg 267]</span> "Say it again, clearer."
"RAT-A-PLAN&mdash;NO&mdash;TOWN&mdash;MA-JOR," the Adjutant
repeated. There was a pause; then he heard the somebody give off an
awed "Good Lord!" and drop the receiver. Next morning in <i>Funny
Cuts</i> (the organ of Intelligence) we learned that "Corps
Headquarters was heavily shelled last night. The Town Major is
missing. This is evidence that the enemy has brought long-range
guns into the opposite sector." Followed masses of information as
to the probable make of the guns, the size of shell they preferred,
the life-story of the Battery Commander, his favourite flower and
author.</p>
<p>The Bosch, always on the alert to snaffle the paying devices of
an opposition firm, now has his "I." staff and <i>Funny Cuts</i> as
well. From time to time we capture a copy and read this sort of
thing:&mdash;</p>
<p>"From agonised screeches heard by one of our intrepid airmen
while patrolling over the enemy's lines yesterday, it is evident
that the brutal and relentless British are bayonetting their
prisoners."</p>
<p>A Highland Division, whose star pipers were holding a dirge and
lament contest on that date, are now ticking off the hours to the
next offensive.</p>
<p>The Antrims had a <i>cordon bleu</i> by the name of Michael
O'Callagan. He was a sturdy rogue, having retreated all the way
from Mons, and subsequently advanced all the way back to the Yser
with a huge stock-pot on his back, from which he had furnished
mysterious stews to all comers, at all hours, under any conditions.
For this, and for the fact that he could cook under water, and
would turn out hot meals when other <i>chefs</i> were committing
suicide, much was forgiven him, but he was prone to look upon the
<i>vin</i> when it was <i>rouge</i> and was habitually coated an
inch thick with a varnish of soot and pot-black. One morning he
calmly hove himself over the parapet and, in spite of the earnest
attentions of Hun snipers, remained there long enough to collect
sufficient <i>d&eacute;bris</i> to boil his dixies. Next day the
Bosch <i>Funny Cuts</i> flared forth scareheads:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SAVAGES ON THE SOMME.</p>
<p>"The desperate and unprincipled British are employing black
cannibal Zulus in the defence of their system. Yesterday one of
them, a chief of incredibly depraved appearance, was observed
scouting in the open."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The communiqu&eacute; ended with a treatise on the Zulu, its

<h2>SECOND CHILDHOOD.</h2>
<p>I must make a confession to someone. I have wasted raw material
which is a substitute for something else indispensable for
defeating the Hun, and probably traitor is the right name for me.
Let me explain.</p>
<p>Somewhere in Nutshire there is a place called Cotterham. It is
one of those little villages which somehow nobody expects to meet
nowadays outside the pages of a KATE GREENAWAY painting book. There
is the village green, with its pond and geese and absurdly pretty
cottages with gardens full of red bergamot and lads'-love, and a
little school where the children are still taught to curtsey and
pull their forelocks when the Squire goes by. And beyond the Green,
at the end of Plough Lane and after you have crossed Leg-o'-Mutton
Common, you come to Down Wood, and if you don't meet Little Red
Riding-Hood on the way or come on Snow White and her seven dwarfs,
that is only because you must have taken the wrong turning after
you came through the kissing-gate at the bottom of Lovers' Lane. I
am a native of Cotterham, and in my more reflective moments I
wonder why such an idyllic place should have produced anything so
unromantic as myself, His Majesty's Deputy Assistant Acting
Inspector for All Sorts of Unexpected Explosives. Cotterham still
has a large place in my affections, and it gave me a considerable
shock the other day to get a letter from the Squire, who is an old
friend, asking me down for a week-end, and adding, "You can do a
little professional job for me too. You really will be interested
to see what splendid work is being done here in your line of fire.
The output is some of the best in the district. But there has been
trouble lately and the leaders of the two biggest shifts were found
to have appropriated a substantial part of the output to their own
uses. I shall rely on you to straighten things out and suggest the
right penalties."</p>
<p>So they were even making munitions in Cotterham. I conjured up
visions of interminable rows of huts, of thousands of overalled
workers swamping Plough Lane, trampling the Green brown, scaring
the geese, obliterating the immemorial shape of Leg-o'-Mutton
Common by a mushroom township, laying Down Wood low, and coming to
me with some miserable tale of petty pilfering for my adjustment. I
must own I got out of the train at Muddlehampstead and into the
station fly feeling distinctly low-spirited. It was some
consolation to find that the railway still stopped seven miles
short of my village, though I reflected gloomily that the place
itself was doubtless a network of light railways by this time. We
bowled along in stately fashion up Plough Lane and past Halfpenny
Cross to the Manor House with its thatched roof and
Virginia-creeper all over the porch. The Squire carried me off at
once for the professional part of my visit, but we fell to talking
of fishing, which had been good, and cubbing, which had been bad,
and were on to Leg-o'-Mutton Common before I remembered to speak of
munitions.</p>
<p>"Not much sign of war here," I said with a relieved sigh. "I was
afraid they'd have spoilt the dear old heath for a certainty. Only
don't say it's Down Wood they've gone to, for that'd be more than I
could stand. I thought there were fairies there long after I ought
to have been a hard-headed young man of six, and if they've gone
and desecrated that wood with factories&mdash;"</p>
<p>The Squire smiled.</p>
<p>"I don't think I should worry. Amongst all your Unexpected
Explosives do you happen to condescend to have heard of the gentle
horse-chestnut and the school-children that collect them? Here are
the two delinquents I wrote to you about, and we've caught them in
the act. Just look at them wasting the precious things."</p>
<p>Two small boys were playing at conkers, two small boys with very
earnest faces and grubby clothes which never figured in KATE
GREENAWAY'S pictures, wasting precious material which
five-and-thirty other scholars were diligently collecting and
stuffing into sacks. I ought to have given them a lecture on
patriotism&mdash;the army behind the Army. But we each of us keep
one childish passion untamed, even if we are unromantic old
bachelors, and I, His Majesty's Deputy Assistant Acting Inspector
for All Sorts of Unexpected Explosives and his very loyal subject,
who have lived for nearly half-a-century of Octobers in London
town&mdash;I borrowed the bigger conker and systematically and in
deadly earnest I fought and defeated the other small boy.</p>
<p>They say that treason never succeeds; so perhaps I can't be a
traitor after all.</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE UNDISMAYED.</h3>
<p>In a world of insecurity and change it is good to have one
bedrock certainty upon which the mind can rest. Thrones totter and
fall; Commanders-in-chief are superseded; Admirals of the High
Fleet are displaced; in politics leaders come and go and
reputations pass; in ordinary life a thousand mutations are
visible. But amid all this flux there remains mercifully one
resolute piece of routine that nothing can alter. Whatever may be
happening elsewhere in the world&mdash;mutinies in the German Navy,
revolutions in Russia, advances in France, advances in
Flanders&mdash;Leicester Square keeps its head. Armageddon may be
turning the world upside down, but it cannot cause those old
antagonists, STEVENSON and REECE, to cease their perpetual contest;
and if the War lasts another ten years you will read in <i>The
Times</i> of October 17th, 1927, a paragraph to the effect that "at
the close of play yesterday in the billiard match of 16,000 points
up between Stevenson and Reece, at the Grand Hall, Leicester
Square, the scores were: Reece (in play), 4,676; Stevenson,
2,837."</p>

<h2>CROSS-TALK WITH PETHERTON.</h2>
<p>Petherton and I have just emerged from another bombardment.
Certain correspondence in <i>The Surbury Gazette and North Herts
Courier</i> gave me a welcome excuse for firing what I may term a
sighting shot. I wrote to my genial neighbour as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>DEAR MR. PETHERTON,&mdash;No doubt you have seen the recent
letters in the local paper anent the remains of the old Cross,
which are at once an ornament to Castle Street, Surbury, and a
standing menace to the peace of mind of the local antiquarians.</p>
<p>I am exceedingly interested in the matter myself and feel that
the views of one who, I am sure, adds a wide knowledge of
arch&aelig;ology to the long list of his accomplishments, would be
both interesting and instructive to myself and (if you would allow
your views to be published) to our little community in general.</p>
<p>If therefore you will write and let me know your opinion on the
matter I shall take it as a friendly and cousinly (<i>vide</i>
certain eighteenth-century documents in the Record Office) act.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>HENRY J. FORDYCE.</p>
<p>Petherton replied with a whizz-bang as thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR,&mdash;I have read the idiotic correspondence to which you
refer, and am informed that you are the author of the screed which
appeared in last Saturday's issue of the paper. If my informant is
correct as to the authorship of the letter I can only say it is a
pity that, with apparently no knowledge of the subject, you should
venture into print. Anyone enjoying the least acquaintance with the
rudiments of English history would be perfectly aware that the
remains have no connection with QUEEN ELEANOR whatever. The
whereabouts of all the crosses put up to her memory are quite well
known to arch&aelig;ologists.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>FREDERICK PETHERTON.</p>
<p>I replied with light artillery:&mdash;</p>
<p>DEAR PETHERTON,&mdash;Yours <i>re</i> the late Mrs. EDWARD
PLANTAGENET to hand.</p>
<p>Though not a professed arch&aelig;ologist I do know something of
the ruin in question, having several times examined it and having
heard, perhaps, most, if not all, the various theories concerning
it. I have been here a good deal longer than you have, I believe,
and cannot think that you know more of the subject than I.</p>
<p>Have you read Wycherley's treatise on the Eleanor Crosses? [I
invented this monograph for the purpose of inducing Petherton to
reload.] If not, why not? Perhaps you would like to dispute the
existence of a castle on the site where the Castle Farm now stands,
and where such shameless profiteering is carried on in eggs and
butter?</p>
<p>By the way, how is your poultry? I notice that your
<i>seizi&egrave;me si&egrave;cle</i> rooster wants his tail
remodelling. Perhaps you are not worrying about new plumage for him
till after the War, though it seems like carrying patriotism to
absurd lengths.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>HENRY J. FORDYCE.</p>
<p>I hope you will allow your letter to be published in <i>The
Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>In reply to this Petherton discharged with:&mdash;</p>
<p>SIR,&mdash;I am not concerned with the castle, which may or may
not have existed in Surbury, nor am I interested in your friend's
monograph on Eleanor Crosses. Other people besides yourself have
the impudence to rush into print on matters of which they are
sublimely ignorant.</p>
<p>Perhaps I had better inform you that EDWARD I. reigned at the
end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth centuries
(1272-1307), not in the fifteenth, and a very slight knowledge of
architecture would convince you that the Surbury relics are not
earlier than the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>Trusting you will not commit any further absurdities, though I
am not too sanguine,</p>
<p>I am, Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>FREDERICK PETHERTON.</p>
<p>My views are not for publication. I <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg 270]</span> prefer
not to be mixed up in such a symposium.</p>
<p>It was evident that my neighbour's weapon was beginning to get
heated, so I flicked him with some more light artillery to draw him
on, and loosed off with:&mdash;</p>
<p>Dear Old Man,&mdash;What a historian you are! You have JOHN
RICHARD GREEN beaten to his knees, FROUDE and GARDINER out of
sight, and even the authoress of the immortal <i>Little Arthur</i>
could not have placed EDDY I. with greater chronological
exactitude. In fact there seems to be no subject on which you
cannot write informatively, which makes me sorry that you will not
join in the literary fray in the local paper, as it deprives the
natives of a great treat.</p>
<p>But&mdash;there is a but, my dear Fred&mdash;I cannot admit your
claim to superior knowledge of the Surbury relics. Remember, I have
grown up with them as it were. Yours ever,</p>
<p>HARRY FORDYCE.</p>
<p>Sir (exploded Petherton),&mdash;What senseless drivel you write
on the least provocation! Whether you grew up with the Surbury
relics or not, you have certainly decayed with them. Every stone
that's left of that confounded ruin (probably only a simple
market-cross) proclaims the date of its birth. Even the broken
finial and the two crockets lying on the ground expose your
ignorance. Eleanor Cross, bah!</p>
<p>Yours flly., F. PETHERTON.</p>
<p>I thought it was time to emerge from my literary camouflage and
let off a heavy howitzer; which I did, with the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>Dear Freddy,&mdash;I am afraid you have got hold of the wrong
end of the stick and laid an egg in a mare's nest. [These mixed
metaphors were designed to tease him into a further barrage.] I did
not write, and I do not remember saying that I had written, the
letter to the paper which seems to have given you as much pleasure
as it has given me. I had no hand in the symposium, but the way you
have brought your Chesterfield battery into action has been so
masterly that I, for one, can never regret that you were
misinformed. I believe the particular letter to <i>The Gazette</i>
was written by one of the staff, a native of the place, who
probably carved his name on the base in his youth, and has felt a
personal interest in the Cross ever since. I hope with this new
light on the affair you will favour me with your further views on
history and arch&aelig;ology.</p>
<p>Yours ever, Harry.</p>
<p>How lovely the blackberries are looking after the rain!</p>
<p>But I couldn't draw Petherton's fire again, for his gun had been
knocked out by this direct hit.</p>

<h2>THE NEW MRS. MARKHAM.</h2>
<h3>CONVERSATION ON CHAPTER LX.</h3>
<p><i>Mary.</i> I wish, Mamma, that there were not so many shocking
stories in history.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> History is, indeed, a sad catalogue of human
miseries, and one is glad to turn aside from the horrors of war to
the amenities of private life. Shall I tell you something of the
domestic habits of the English in the early twentieth century?</p>
<p><i>Mary.</i> Oh do, Mamma; I shall like that very much.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> The nobility and the well-to-do classes no longer
lived shut up in gloomy castles, but made a point of spending most
of their time in public. They never took their meals at home, but
habitually frequented large buildings called restaurants, fitted up
with sumptuous and semi-Sultanic splendour. In these halls, while
the guests sat at a number of tables, they were entertained by
minstrels and singers. It was even said that they acquired the
habit of eating and drinking in time to the music. They were waited
upon for the most part by foreigners, who spoke broken English, and
what with the babel of tongues, the din of the music and the
constant popping of corks, for alcohol had not yet been prohibited,
the scene beggared description.</p>
<p><i>Richard.</i> Well, I am sure I would rather dine in our neat
little dining-room, with our silent wireless waiter, than partake
of the most extravagant repasts in those sumptuous halls.</p>
<p><i>George.</i> I must just ask you, Mamma, about one thing that
has all along puzzled me very much. What was the House of Lords
about all this time that they let the House of Commons govern the
country and have their own way in everything?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> I am afraid, my dear George, that you are
animated by a somewhat reactionary bias in favour of feudalism,
which in your own best interests you would do well to curb. It is
enough to say that some of the peers supported the House of
Commons, and the majority were too timid to make any stand against
the numbers and violence of the other House. Nowadays, thanks to
the wide diffusion of peerages and the fact that they are conferred
far more freely on persons of advanced political views, this lack
of independence has largely been eliminated.</p>
<p><i>Richard.</i> I am sure we must all thank you for the trouble
you took to explain about Free Trade and Protection; but if you are
not too tired will you kindly tell us something about the learned
and clever men who lived at this time?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> You know, my dear boy, that I am always happy to
impart information, and am pleased to have such attentive
listeners. The authoress of your favourite poems, Mary, lived in
this reign. I mean Mrs. ELLA WHEELER WILCOX. The Rev. H.G. WELLS,
the famous theologian who abolished the Latin and Greek grammars;
the Baroness Corkscrew&mdash;to call her by the name under which
she was ultimately elevated to the peerage&mdash;who wrote so many
beautiful historical romances that she quite superseded Sir WALTER
SCOTT; Sir JOHN OXENHAM, one of England's greatest poets; and Lord
HALL-CAINE, author of <i>Isle of Man Power</i>, were commanding
figures in this period.</p>
<p><i>Richard.</i> Oh, Mamma, did not Lord HALL-CAINE discover the
North Pole?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Not that I am aware of, my dear boy, though it is
quite possible. But you are probably confusing him with the Arctic
explorer, Dr. KANE. Among the scientific men I must mention Sir
WILLIAM ROBERTSON NICOLL, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page273"
id="page273"></a>[pg 273]</span> the great Scots agriculturist who
first applied intensive culture to the kailyard; General BELLOC,
the illustrious topographer, and HAROLD BEGBIE, who discovered and
popularized Sir OLIVER LODGE.</p>
<p><i>Richard.</i> Ah, Mamma, I know enough about the Georgians to
feel sure that you have left out a great many things. You have
never told us about the Marquis of NORTHCLIFFE'S discovery of
America, his introduction of the potato to that Continent, and his
building of the Yellow House in the Yellowstone Park.</p>
<p><i>George.</i> And you have not fully satisfied our curiosity
about Sir GEORGE ROBEY, Baronet, Lord LAUDER, Sir CHARLES CHAPLIN
and other great Leaders of English Society.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> True, my dear, but you must read their lives in
the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>, for here is the tea,
and I must leave off.</p>
<hr />
<h2>ALLIRAP ASRAS.</h2>
<p>It would be interesting to know more of this great Persian
ruler, but history being reticent our chance has gone, unless it
should be the good fortune of some member of Sir STANLEY MAUDE'S
expedition, rummaging in the archives of Baghdad, to come upon new
facts. Meanwhile I offer the name as a terse and snappy one for a
Persian kitten, such as I saw the other day convert several
shillings'-worth of my aunt's Berlin wool (as it is still, I
believe, called, in spite of <i>The Daily Mail</i>) into sheer
scrap. Knitting however is not what it was in the early days of the
War and the tragedy led to no bloodshed, my aunt, who has evidently
an emulative admiration for Sir ISAAC NEWTON, merely shaking her
finger. But self-control among women must be on the increase, for
in a hotel the other day I overheard a coffee-room conversation in
which two cases were instanced of supreme heroism under agonising
conditions&mdash;one being when a butler (an old and honoured
butler too, who had never misconducted himself before) fainted
while carrying round the after-dinner coffee and poured most of it
over the ample shoulders of a dowager. This lady not only
disregarded the pain and the damp, but assisted in bringing the
butler to. The Distinguished Service Order has been given for less
than that.</p>
<p>It was either in this hotel or another that I met the Naval
officer among whose duties is the granting or refusing of permits
to amateur photographers in districts where "Dora" does not wish
for enemy cameras. Among the requirements of the form which has to
be filled up is one asking the applicant, in the interests of
identification, to specify any peculiar skin marks. One lady, with
a conscientiousness not excelled by the actor who blacked himself
all over to play <i>Othello</i>, stated that she had only an
appendicitis scar.</p>
<p>But I am digressing. Where was I? Oh yes, we were discussing
that great Persian, Allirap Asras. Those authorities who think that
he was a predecessor of BAHRAM, the hunter, are wrong, for there
was never any Persian of the name at all. I am sorry to have
deceived you, but you must blame not me but a certain domestic
remedy. If one bright cart, drawn by a mettled steed and dispensing
this medicinal beverage at a penny a glass, will insist upon being
outside Westminster Abbey and another at the top of Cockspur Street
every working day of the week for ever and ever, how can one help
sooner or later spelling its staple product backwards and
embroidering a little on the result?</p>
<p>But what I want to know is&mdash;who drinks sarsaparilla,
anyway?</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>"'Way up in the wild North Country, a couple of years ago</p>
<p>I hauled Hank out of a snowdrift&mdash;it was maybe thirty
'below,'</p>
<p>And I packed him along to my shanty and I took and thawed him
with snow.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"He was stiff as a cold-store bullock, I might have left him for
dead,</p>
<p>But I packed him along, as I've told you, and melted him out
instead,</p>
<p>And I rolled him up in my blankets and put him to sleep in my
bed.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"So he dwelt in my humble shanty while the wintry gales did
roar,</p>
<p>While the blizzards howled in the passes and the timber wolves
at the</p>
<p class="i4">door,</p>
<p>And he slept in my bunk at night-time while I stretched out on
the floor.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"He watched me frying my bacon and he said that the smell was
grand;</p>
<p>He watched me bucking the stove-wood, but he never lent me a
hand,</p>
<p>And he played on my concertina the airs of his native land.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"And one month grew into two months and two months grew into
three,</p>
<p>And there he was sitting and smiling like a blooming Old Man of
the Sea,</p>
<p>Eating my pork and beans up and necking my whisky and tea.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"You say, 'Why didn't I shift him?' For the life o' me I
dunno;</p>
<p>I suppose there's something inside me that can't tell a fellow
to go</p>
<p>I hauled by the heels from a snowdrift at maybe thirty
'below.'...</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"But at last, when the snows were going and the blue Spring
skies</p>
<p class="i4">were pale,</p>
<p>Out after bear in the valley I met a chap on the
trail&mdash;</p>
<p>A chap coming up from the city, who stopped and told me a
tale&mdash;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A tale of a red war raging all over the land and sea,</p>
<p>And when he was through I was laughing, for the joke of it
seemed to be</p>
<p>That Hank was a goldarn German&mdash;and Hank was rooming with
me!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"So off I hiked to the shanty, and never a word I said,</p>
<p>I floated in like a cyclone, I yanked him out of my bed,</p>
<p>And I grabbed the concertina and smashed it over his head.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I shook him up for a minute, I stood him down on the floor,</p>
<p>I grabbed the scruff of his trousers and ran him along to the
door,</p>
<p>And I said, 'This here, if you get me, is a Declaration of
War!'</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"And I gave him a hoist with my gum-boot, a kind of a lift with
my toe;</p>
<p>But you can't give a fellow a hiding, as anyone sure must
know,</p>
<p>When you hauled him out of a snowdrift at maybe thirty

<h3>"ONE HOUR OF LIFE."</h3>
<p>In Captain DESMOND COKE'S extravaganza a group of
philanthropists adopt the time-honoured procedure of ROBIN HOOD and
his Greenwood Company, robbing Dives on system to pay Lazarus.
Their economics are sounder than their sociology, which is of the
crudest. They specialize in jewellery&mdash;useless, barbaric and
generally vulgar survivals&mdash;which they extract from shop and
safe, and sell in Amsterdam, distributing the proceeds to various
deserving charitable agencies. In this particular crowded hour of
life the leader of the group, a fanatical prig with hypnotic eyes,
abducts the beautiful <i>Lady Fenton</i>, with ten thousand pounds'
worth of stuff upon her, from one of the least ambitious of Soho
restaurants.</p>
<p>How came she there, thus bedizened? Well, her husband, eccentric
peer with a priceless collection of snuffboxes and a chronic
deficiency of humour, had arranged the little dinner to effect a
reconciliation, away from the prying eyes of their set. It was not
a success. She felt that she sparkled too much, was piqued, and
dismissed her lord. Enter the hypnotic prig, who adroitly conveys
her to his headquarters, preaches to her and converts her to the
point of surrendering her jewels without a pang, and offering to
assist in the lifting of the snuffboxes. I can't say more without
endangering the effect of Captain COKE'S ingenious shifts and
spoofs.</p>
<p>The author seemed to me to tempt Providence by placing his
perfervid philanthropist and his serious doctrines against a
background of burlesque. But he succeeded in entertaining his
audience. Miss LILLAH MCCARTHY, looking her very best as <i>Lady
Fenton</i>, and Mr. COWLEY WRIGHT, looking quite plausible as the
irresistible chief of the General Charities Distribution Bureau,
shared the chief honours of the evening.</p>

<h2>SUGAR.</h2>
<p>"Francesca," I said, "you must be very deeply occupied; for ten
minutes I have not heard your silvery voice."</p>
<p>"I am attempting," she said, "to fill up our sugar form."</p>
<p>"Is it a tremendous struggle?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, "it is a regular brain-smasher."</p>
<p>"Give me the paper, and let me have a go at it."</p>
<p>With a haggard face, but without a word, she handed me the buff
form, and sat silently while I read the various explanations and
directions.</p>
<p>"Francesca," I said, "you are doing wrong. It says that the form
must be filled up and signed by a responsible member of the
household. Now you can say that you're brilliant or amiable or
handsome or powerful or domineering, but can you honestly say
you're responsible? No, you can't. So I shall keep this form and
fill it up myself in due time, and leave you to look after the hens
or talk to the gardener."</p>
<p>"Anybody," she said, "who can wring a smile from a gardener, as
I have this morning, is entitled to be considered responsible.
Infirm of purpose! hand me the paper."</p>
<p>"Very well," I said, "you can have the paper; only remember
that, if we get fined a thousand pounds for transgressing the
Defence of the Realm Act, you mustn't ask me for the money. You
must pay it yourself."</p>
<p>"I'll chance that," she said, as I handed back the paper.</p>
<p>"Now then, we shan't be long. Which of these two addresses shall
we have?"</p>
<p>"How do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Why, they tell you to fill in the address in capital letters,
and then they give you two to pick from. One is 1000, Upper
Grosvenor Street, W. 1&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It is a longer street than I had supposed."</p>
<p>"And the other," she continued, "is 17, Church Lane, Middlewich,
Cheshire."</p>
<p>"Let it be Middlewich," I said. "Since boyhood's hour I have
dreamt of living in Middlewich. As for the other, I simply couldn't
live in a street of a thousand houses. Could you?"</p>
<p>"No," she said, "I couldn't. We'll be Middlewichians.... There,
it's done. Capital letters and all."</p>
<p>"Don't slack off," I said. "Fill it all up now that you've got
started."</p>
<p>"I suppose I'd better begin with myself."</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "you may have that privilege. Put it down quick:
Carlyon, Francesca; age blank, because they don't want ages over
eighteen; F for female, and Married Woman for occupation. Then
treat me in the same way, putting M for F, and 2nd Lieutenant of
Volunteers instead of Married Woman."</p>
<p>"Why shouldn't I put Married Man as your occupation?"</p>
<p>"Simply because it isn't done. It's a splendid occupation, but
it isn't recognised as such in formal documents."</p>
<p>"Another injustice to women. I shall enter you as Married
Man."</p>
<p>"Enter me as anything you like," I said, "only let's get on with
the job."</p>
<p>"Very well; you're down as Married Man."</p>
<p>"Now get on with the children. Muriel first. What about
her?"</p>
<p>"But she's away having her education finished."</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "but she'll be back for the holidays, and she'll
want her sugar then, like the rest of us. And Frederick is away at
<i>his</i> school, probably getting much better sugar than we are.
He'll be wanting his ration in the holidays. You'd better put a
note about that."</p>
<p>"A note?" she said. "There's no room for notes on this form. All
they want is a bald statement. And that's just what they can't get.
They'll have to take it with the hair on. I'm cramming in about the
holidays, and I hope Lord RHONDDA will be pleased with all the
information he's getting about our family."</p>
<p>"Keep going," I said; "you've still got the servants to do."</p>
<p>"Yes, but the kitchenmaid's gone, and I haven't engaged another
one yet."</p>
<p>"Don't let that worry you," I said. "Write
down&mdash;Kitchenmaid about to be engaged. Name will be supplied
later.'"</p>
<p>"You're quite brilliant to-day. There, that's finished, thank
Heaven."</p>
<p>"Not yet. You've got to address it to the Local Food
Office."</p>
<p>"But I haven't the remotest where the Local Food Office is. It
can't have been there more than a short time, anyhow."</p>
<p>"Hurrah!" I said, looking over her shoulder at the document. "It
says if you are in doubt as to the name of the district of your
Local Food Office you are to inquire of any policeman or special
constable."</p>
<p>"That's all very well," she said, "but how are we to find a
policeman in this remote and peaceful place? I've never seen one.
Have you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "I think I saw one last year on a bicycle."</p>
<p>"Well, he's probably arrived somewhere else by this time. He's
no good to us."</p>
<p>"No, but we might find a special constable."</p>
<p>"I'll tell you what," she said, "old Glumgold is a special
constable. I heard him complaining bitterly of having been hauled
out of bed during the last air-raid on London. 'No nigher to we nor
forty mile,' he said it was. He's sure to be among the cabbages. Be
a dear and dash out and ask him."</p>
<p>So I found Glumgold in among the cabbages and asked him where
the Local Food Office was, and he said he'd be gingered if he knew,
he or his old woman either; and that was the question they was
a-going to arst of us, because to-day was the last day for sending
in. So I advised him to chance it with Nebsbury, which happens to
be eight miles off and possesses a High Street; and then I went
back to Francesca and told her that Glumgold advised
Nebsbury&mdash;which was cowardly, but one can't spend a lifetime
over a fiddle-headed document like that. Anyhow, we folded it up
and posted it, and we've heard nothing since.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>
<p>Not for a great while have I met a story at once so moving and
so simply made as <i>Summer</i> (MACMILLAN). Of course at this time
the art of EDITH WHARTON is no new discovery; but to my thinking
she has never done better work than this tale of a New England
village, and the wakening to love of the girl who was drowsing away
her youth there. It is all, as I say, so simple, and written with
such apparent economy of effort, that only afterwards does the
amazing cleverness of Mrs. WHARTON'S method impress itself upon the
reader. <i>Charity Royall</i> was a waif, of worse than ambiguous
parentage, brought up in a community where her passionate and
violently sensitive nature was stifled. Two men loved
her&mdash;dour middle-aged Lawyer <i>Royall</i>, whose house she
kept, and <i>Lucius Harney</i>, the young visitor from the city,
the fairy-prince of poor <i>Charity's</i> one great romance,
through whom came tragedy. You see already the whole stark
simplicity of the theme. What I cannot convey to you is that secret
of Mrs. WHARTON'S that enables her by some exquisitely right word
or phrase so to illuminate a scene that you see it as though by an
inspiration of your own, and feel that thus and thus did the thing
in fact happen. There are episodes in <i>Summer</i>&mdash;for
example the Fourth of July firework evening, or the wildly macabre
scene of the night funeral on the mountain&mdash;that seem to me to
come as near perfection in their telling as anything I am ever
likely to read, and when you have enjoyed them for yourself I fancy
you will be inclined to join me in very sincere gratitude for work
of such rare quality.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Those who admired (which is the same as saying those who read)
that excellent book, <i>The Retreat from Mons</i>, will be glad to
hear that its author, Major A. CORBETT-SMITH, has now continued his
record in a further volume, called <i>The Marne and After</i>
(CASSELL). In it you will find all those qualities, a sane and
soldier-like common-sense, an entire absence of gush, and a saving
humour in the midst of horrors, which made the earlier installment
memorable. Above all else I have been impressed by the first of
these characteristics. Major CORBETT-SMITH writes from the
viewpoint of one to whom even this ghastliest of wars is part of
the day's work. That he sees its human and hideous sides by no
means impairs this quiet professional outlook. I recall one phrase
in his chapter on the secret agents of the enemy: "At the Aisne
German spies were a regular plague"&mdash;just as one might speak
of wasps or weather&mdash;which somehow conveyed to me very vividly
the secret of our original little army's disproportionate influence
in the early weeks of the War. The operations which we call the
actual Battle of the Marne (surely fated to be the most
fought-again engagement in history) are here very clearly
described, with illustrative plans; while one other chapter, called
suggestively "<i>Kultur</i>," may be commended to those
super-philosophers amongst us who are already beginning an attempt
to belittle the foul record of calculated crime that must for at
least a generation place Germany outside the pale of civilization.
For this grim chapter alone I should like to see Major
CORBETT-SMITH'S otherwise cheery volume scattered broadcast over
the country.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>June</i> (METHUEN) is saturated with the simple
sentimentality in which American authors excel. I do not know
whether British novelists could write this sort of book
successfully if they would, but I do know that they don't. Miss
EDITH BARNARD DELANO, however, succeeds in getting considerable
charm into her story, and if it leaves rather a sweeter taste in
the mouth than some of us relish there are others who like their
fiction to be strongly sugared. <i>June</i>, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg 278]</span> an
orphan child, was looked after by nigger servants, and by one,
<i>Mammy</i>, in particular. She possessed a house and a valley;
and a young man prospecting in the latter met with an accident and
was discovered by the child. Hence complications, and the removal
of <i>June</i> from her home to be educated with some cousins. Then
poverty, hard times and plenty of pluck. But the clouds began to
lift when <i>June</i> discovered that an emerald cross of hers was
worth four thousand dollars; and finally the sun burst forth when,
through the agency of the accidental young man, her property was
found to be very valuable, and she more valuable still&mdash;to the
young man. It sounds ingenuous, doesn't it? But not nearly so easy
to write as it seems, for to produce anything as artless as
<i>June</i> is an art in itself.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>In <i>The Book of the Happy Warrior</i> (LONGMANS) a chivalrous
modern knight holds up to our youngsters the patterns of an older
chivalry to teach them courage, clean fighting and devoted service.
Sir HENEY NEWBOLT claims that the tradition of the public schools
is the direct survival of the medi&aelig;val training for
knighthood, and incidentally defends flannelled and muddied youth
from hasty aspersions. ROLAND and his OLIVER, RICHARD LION-HEART,
EDWARD the Black Prince and CHANDOS, DU GUESCLIN and BAYARD, if
they revisited this tortured earth, would be dismayed by the
procedure and the chilling impersonality of modern war. Perhaps in
the glorious single combats of the Flying Corps they might
recognise some faint semblance of their ancient method. Sir HENRY,
rightly from his point of view, chooses to ignore the wholesale
horrors of to-day's warfare and to emphasize the ideal of fighting
service as a fine discipline and proof of manly worth. He shows an
obvious, honest, aristocratic bias, but he does not forget another
side of the matter, as a fragment of an imaginary conversation
between a young lord and a squire present at the great tourney at
St. Inglebert's between the Gentlemen of England and of France
pleasantly shows. The Englishmen were worsted and took their defeat
in a fine sporting spirit. "How is it we're beaten? We always win
the battles, don't we?" asks the boy. "The archers win them for
us," says the Squire. Quite a characteristic little touch of
subaltern modesty! One thought occurs to me especially. It is
unthinkable that a book like this should appear in the Germany of
to-day. It will be worth your while giving it to your boy to find
out why.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Since the practice of writing first novels is becoming
increasingly popular with young authors it was inevitable that a
"First Novel Library" should find its way on to the market. Whether
the classification is to be construed as an appeal for forbearance
for the shortcomings of the neophyte, or as a warning which a
considerate publisher feels is due to the public, is not for me to
say. But the policy of charging six shillings for these maiden
efforts&mdash;all that is required of us for the mature
masterpieces of our MAURICE HEWLETTS and ARNOLD BENNETTS&mdash;is
open to question. <i>The Puppet</i>, by JANE HARDING (UNWIN), is
not without merit, but the faults of the beginner are present in
manifold. The heroine tells her story in the first person&mdash;a
difficult method of handling fiction at the best&mdash;and in the
result we find a young lady of no particular education or apparent
attainments holding forth in the stilted diction of a rather prosy
early-Victorian Archbishop. The effect of unreality produced goes
far to spoil a plot which is wound and unwound with considerable
skill. Miss HARDING will write a good novel yet, but she must learn
to make her characters act the parts she assigns to them.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We all must be writing books about the War. It is natural enough
to suppose one's own share of war-work is worthy of record, and
indeed, when we come to think of it, the historian of the future
will get his complete picture of the time only when he realises how
every scrap of the national energy was absorbed in the one master
purpose. That being so it is arguable that Mr. WARD MUIR was
thinking far ahead in compiling his hospital reminiscences,
<i>Observations of an Orderly</i> (SIMPKIN). One hastens to make it
clear that the last thing intended or desired is to disparage the
usefulness or the stark self-sacrifice of the men who are serving
in menial capacities in our war hospitals, but to tell the truth
this account of sculleries and laundry-baskets, polishing paste and
nigger minstrels, bathrooms and pillow-slips, has not much
intrinsic interest about it, nor are the author's general
reflections very different from what one could supply oneself
without much effort. His notes on war slang are about the best
thing in the volume, and I liked the story of the blinded
soldiers&mdash;feeling anything in the world but mournful or
pathetic&mdash;who played pranks on the Tube escalator; but on the
whole this is a book which will be of considerable interest only to
the writer's fellow-labourers. They, beyond any doubt, will be glad
to read this history of their familiar rounds and common tasks.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p><i>Wanted, a Tortoise-Shell</i> (LANE) would have made an
excellent short story, but to pursue its farcical developments
through three hundred pages requires a considerable amount of
perseverance. The scene of Mr. PETER BLUNDER'S book is laid in
tropical Jallagar, where the British Resident was keener on cats
than on his duties. A male tortoise-shell was what he fanatically
and almost ferociously desired, and to obtain it he was ready to
barter his daughter to one <i>Kamp</i>, who is tersely described as
"a fat Swede." I conceived a strong distaste for this large and
perspiring man, and can congratulate Mr. BLUNDELL on having created
a character odious enough to linger in the memory. For the rest
there are some gleams of real fun where a beach-comber tries to
palm off a dyed cat as the long-deferred tortoise-shell, and the
exit of this animal from a world too covetous to hold it is
thoroughly sound farce. But on the whole I failed to get many of
those quiet gurgles of delight which are the best tribute one can
pay to a funny man's work.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
